# Azure_Cloud_honeypot

This is a project on deploying a proactive security intelligence gathering tool in Azure Cloud; a honeypot. A honeypot is a security system that presents itself as a false target or vulnerability, on the system you wish to protect. It is a trap for hackers, looking to exploit vulnerabilities in systems. Using this method, cybersecurity personnel can learn about potential adversaries, their tools, their techniques and procedures, and how they would attempt to circumvent the organization's actual security controls. 

It should be noted that cybercriminals are aware of honeypots, and could also potentially use them as decoys to spread wrong information to cybersecurity researchers.

The honeypot that will be deployed in this project is "T-Pot - The All In One Honeypot Platform";
